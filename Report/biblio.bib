abstract="The application of suitable numerical boundary conditions for hyperbolic conservation laws on domains with complex geometry has become a problem with certain difficulty that has been tackled in different ways according to the nature of the numerical methods and mesh type. In this paper we present a technique for the extrapolation of information from the interior of the computational domain to ghost cells designed for structured Cartesian meshes (which, as opposed to non-structured meshes, cannot be adapted to the morphology of the domain boundary). This technique is based on the application of Lagrange interpolation with a filter for the detection of discontinuities that permits a data dependent extrapolation, with higher order at smooth regions and essentially non oscillatory properties near discontinuities.",
